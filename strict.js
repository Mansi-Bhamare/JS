//Ex 1:
"use strict"
a = 10;
console.log(a);          
//It gives clear output without decleration of variable  like(10)
//It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

/*Example: mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. 
In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable. */
